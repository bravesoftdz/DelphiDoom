Getting a Doom IWAD

The IWAD is the main data file containing the graphics and levels for Doom. 
You need one to use PrBoom. If you have a copy of one of the 
original Doom games, copy your Doom, Doom 2, 
Ultimate Doom or Final Doom IWAD (doom.wad, doom2.wad, 
tnt.wad or plutonia.wad) to /usr/local/share/games/doom/. 
Or, if you don't have any of those, use the 
shareware IWAD, which you can get 
from http://www.doomworld.com/ or 
http://www.idsoftware.com/.
