-----------
Small fixes to voxel support.

Version 1.1.5 build 580 - (22/5/2013)
-----------------------------------
Added -fullhd, -vga and -svga command line parameters.
Added force_numwallrenderingthreads_8bit and force_numwallrenderingthreads_32bit console variables, set the number of threads to create for wall rendering.
Loads wad and pk3/pak files from command line without -file and -pakfile
Different savegame filenames for "Death Kings of the Dark Citadel" pak.
Default miditempo changed to 160
Fixed rendering issues when playing levels with fog.
Executes all console commands inside wad lumps with the "AUTOEXEC"name.
Maximum visplanes increased to 8192.
Added line specials 255, create ripple effect to tagged sectors floor or/and ceiling (sector tag=Arg0, floor=Arg1, Ceiling=Arg2).
Added -cga command line parameter.
Corrected bug with mouse sensivity in different screen resolutions.
Replaced old zone memory allocation.
Removed limit on number of visprites, now they are allocated dynamically.
R_SortVisSprites now uses quicksort for better performance.
Added precisescalefromglobalangle console variable, when true uses more precise calculations in software rendering.
Added MF2_EX_FRIGHTENED mobj flag.
Added A_SetFrightened and A_UnSetFrightened mobj functions.
Changed menu font.
New fake3d algorythm, better 3d emulation and faster in software rendering mode.
The idmypos cheat shows also the z coordinate.
Added blancbeforerender command line parameter, blanc screen before render.
Support for voxels in OpenGL rendering mode.
•Added gl_renderwireframe console variable.
Added vx_maxoptimizerpasscount console variable, indicates how many passes at max the voxel mesh optimizer makes. Default is 0 (=use FastOptimize method for acceptable results and good performance)
Support for voxels in software rendering mode, still needs work.

Autoloads required pak/pk3 files inside AUTOLOAD wad lump.
Corrected floorclip bug.
Faster loading when -devparm is defined.
Added A_GoTo, A_GoToIfCloser, A_GoToIfHealthLower mobj functions.
DLIGHTSDRAWRANGE and SHADOWSDRAWRANGE increased to 2048 * FRACUNIT.

Doesn't try to spawn DoomBuilder 3D Editing mode camera (doomednum=32000).
'TEXT' keyword in dehacked files works now with music.
Great speed optimizations in 8 bit color software mode (fps incresed 10-15%).
Added A_ConsoleCommand mobj function.
Turbo scale limited to 200%

--------------------------------------
Displays Disk Buzy icon for 4 ticks instead of 4 frames.
WAD lumps hash indexing for better performance. (using djb2 hash function)
Satan and skel cheats changed to idsatan and idcheat due to problems with WASD key compination for moving
